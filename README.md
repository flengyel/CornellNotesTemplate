## Adaptations
The adaptations were as follows. The command to draw grid lines were replaced with the standard twenty-seven ruled lines. The step size was set grid height 
divided by 27. The cue section width and the summary section height were modified accordingly. Page numbers are suppressed and the margins were modified.
